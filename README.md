# userMeanApp

A simple CRUD using **MEAN** stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node.js).

It allows to register/login users (using token authentication) and add simple story. Users can see stories created by others or only their own stories if they wish to.

I have created this simple app for learning purposes, don`t bother. You can propably write it 100 times better ;-)

## Installing
